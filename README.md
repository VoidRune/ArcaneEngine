# ArcaneEngine

Custom C++ renderer using Vulkan API.

## Minimal code example
Here is a minimal code example that creates a window, sets up a rendering context, renders a triangle to the screen, and then cleans up the resources.

```cpp
auto window = std::make_unique<Arc::Window>(Arc::WindowDescription());

uint32_t inFlightFrameCount = 3;
Arc::PresentMode presentMode = Arc::PresentMode::Mailbox;

auto device = std::make_unique<Arc::Device>(window->GetHandle(), window->GetInstanceExtensions(), inFlightFrameCount);
auto presentQueue = std::make_unique<Arc::PresentQueue>(device.get(), presentMode);
auto resourceCache = std::make_unique<Arc::ResourceCache>(device.get());
auto renderGraph = std::make_unique<Arc::RenderGraph>();

std::string vertSource = R"(
	#version 450
	layout(location = 0) out vec3 outColor;

	vec2 positions[3] = vec2[](
		vec2(0.0, -0.5),
		vec2(0.5, 0.5),
		vec2(-0.5, 0.5)
	);
	vec3 colors[3] = vec3[](
		vec3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0),
		vec3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0),
		vec3(0.0, 0.0, 1.0)
	);

	void main()
	{
		gl_Position = vec4(positions[gl_VertexIndex], 0.0, 1.0);
		outColor = colors[gl_VertexIndex];
	}
	)";
std::string fragSource = R"(
	#version 450
	layout (location = 0) in vec3 inColor;
	layout (location = 0) out vec4 outFragColor;

	void main() 
	{
		outFragColor = vec4(inColor,1.0f);
	}	
	)";

Arc::Shader vertShader;
Arc::Shader fragShader;
Arc::ShaderDesc shaderDesc;
if (Arc::ShaderCompiler::CompileFromSource(vertSource, Arc::ShaderStage::Vertex, shaderDesc, "vert"))
	resourceCache->CreateShader(&vertShader, shaderDesc);
if (Arc::ShaderCompiler::CompileFromSource(fragSource, Arc::ShaderStage::Fragment, shaderDesc, "frag"))
	resourceCache->CreateShader(&fragShader, shaderDesc);

Arc::Pipeline pipeline;
resourceCache->CreatePipeline(&pipeline, Arc::PipelineDesc{
	.ShaderStages = { &vertShader, &fragShader }
});

while (!window->IsClosed())
{
	window->PollEvents();

	Arc::FrameData frameData = presentQueue->BeginFrame();
	Arc::CommandBuffer* cmd = frameData.CommandBuffer;

	renderGraph->SetPresentPass(Arc::PresentPass{
		.LoadOp = Arc::AttachmentLoadOp::Clear,
		.ClearColor = {1, 0.5, 0, 1},
		.ExecuteFunction = [&](Arc::CommandBuffer* cmd, uint32_t frameIndex) {
			cmd->BindPipeline(pipeline.GetHandle());
			cmd->Draw(3, 1, 0, 0);
		}
	});
	renderGraph->BuildGraph();
	renderGraph->Execute(frameData, presentQueue->GetExtent());
	presentQueue->EndFrame();
}
device->WaitIdle();
resourceCache->FreeResources();
```

## Build
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the `Scripts/` directory and run the appropriate `Setup` script to generate project files.

Note that Vulkan SDK is not included in this project and needs to be downloaded manually!

## Volume renderer

We implemented a physically-based, unbiased volumetric path tracer, using Monte Carlo methods for path sampling. Null-collision methods are used to handle heterogeneous media by introducing fictious medium to homogenise the volume.

Delta tracking is used to sample the distance to the next interaction event where absorption, scattering or null-collision happens based on rejection sampling the real and fictious part of the medium. For null-collision methods to remain unbiased we need to know beforehand the maximum density, known as the majorant.

When majorant is not known beforehand, like in dynamic scenes or when the volume is the result of a simulation, selecting the majorant can become tricky. We implement progressive null-tracking that stores the local majorants in a lower resolution grid, majorants are sampled during the simulation and converge in finite amount of samples. DDA algorithm is used  to traverse the grid of majorants effectively skipping large parts of the volume that contain high amount of fictous material.

## Radiance cascades

A 2D implementation of Radiance Cascades based on [this paper](https://github.com/Raikiri/RadianceCascadesPaper) by Alexander Sannikov.

Radiance Cascades is an elegant way of simulating global illumination that produces a noiseless image and does not rely on stochastic sampling like path tracing. It is based on the penumbra hypothesis that essentially tells us, that the penumbra (semi dark part of the shadow) requires higher linear resolution closer to the light source and higher angular resolution further away from it. This means that we need more probes that sample close to the light source and less probes that sample farther away from the source and cast more rays.

These probes are structured in multiple cascades with higher linear resolution at lower casced and higher angular resolutions at higher cascades. Probes store sampled radiance of 4 rays as an optimization and are placed in such a way that hardware interpolation can be used to bilinearly interpolate 4 adjacent probes direction. When cascades are built, we then merge them down into the lowest cascade and use the accumulated radiance to render the scene.

As stated before, this algorithm is noiseless and has constant cost, meaning it is independant of scene complexity, but can nevertheless be quite high.
